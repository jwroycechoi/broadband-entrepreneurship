# Broadband and Entrepreneurship Data

This repository contains data processing and analysis codes, mainly in `R` that are created to collect and combine various datasets related to broadband availability, speed, and local entrepreneurship in the US at the county level. This is a part of a research project by the [Technology and Information Policy Institute (TIPI)](https://texastipi.org) funded by the IC<sup>2</sup> Institute at the University of Texas at Austin.

A dataset is created by collecting data from multiple datasets that are either available for public and obtained personally by the research team. Detailed information about the datasets used is available in specific `R Markdown` documents. The processes are published on a [GitHub website](https://jwroycechoi.github.io) and regularly updated.
